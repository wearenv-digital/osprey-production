							their insurers.<br> The company shall not be liable in respect of any event of default for loss of
							profits, goodwill or any type of special indirect or consequential loss even if such loss was foreseeable

						<p>For Service Support</p>
						<p>1.0 Definitions:<br> 1.1 The Agreement:<br> The Agreement consists of these Terms and Conditions together
							with the quotation or invoice for the service contract.<br> 1.2 The Contract:<br> The Contract means the
							service and maintenance of the Fire and/or Security System as detailed on the previous pages.<br> 1.3

							normal working hours for the purpose of maintaining the Fire and/or Security System. There will be no
							charge made for repairs made during the visit assuming that only minor consumable items are required (e.g.
							fuses, gaskets etc.). Where replacement parts are required (e.g. battery, fire sprinkler head, fire
							extinguisher refill/ exchange etc.), we shall provide replacement equipment up to the value of &pound;300
							without a formal instruction or purchase order, so that repairs can be made during the first visit. Osprey
							Security offers a critical spares plan, whereby replacement parts may be ordered in advance and held
							onsite to reduce callout frequency and increase first fix rates. <br> 1.6 Reactive Service Visit:<br> A
							visit made to the premises at the request of the Customer for any purpose other than routine maintenance.
							Any visit made as a result of operator error, or failure outside the Company&rsquo;s control, will be
							charged according to the Company&rsquo;s standard schedule of rates. Parts will be charged as described in
							the PPM section above. If it is not possible to repair faulty equipment on-site, it may need to be removed
							for workshop repair. If this is necessary, every endeavour will be made to leave the Fire and/or Security
							System in an operational state, even if equipment has been removed. All repairs carried out off site will
							incur a labour and repair charge. Once repairs have been completed the equipment will be returned to site
							and will be subject to travel time cost (applicable for Silver Contract), in addition to the original
							reduced call out charge. Prior approval from the Customer will be required in order to agree these
							additional costs.<br> 1.7 Term and Termination:<br> The Contract Term is from the contract start date for
							a minimum of 36 months continuing thereafter for a further 36 months unless terminated. This agreement
							will automatically renew at the end of each term for a further 36 months unless the Customer provides the
							Company with written notice of termination at least 90 days prior to the end of the contract term. At
							automatic renewal, the Company has the option to increase the contract rates and value by a maximum of
							RPI. Osprey Security reserves the right to make a price change outside the contract Term (a) in the event
							of any change of scope, for example; an increase of equipment to be covered in the contract or (b) if
							Osprey Security&rsquo;s annual costs exceed the contract value by more than 5%. In such cases, formal
							notice will be issued to the Customer 30 days in advance of implementation. The service contract may be
							terminated by either party giving to the other 90 days&rsquo; notice in writing. If the contract terms and
							conditions have been breached, such notice to be served so as to expire at the end of the initial term or
							any subsequent anniversary of the start date of this maintenance agreement. An annual price review will
							apply each year of the service contract. Any additional equipment will be calculated and added to the
							maintenance renewal costs for the next year. When a discounted multiple year contract option is purchased
							and then subsequently terminated by the customer prior to its end date, a charge of 25% of the total
							contract value (not the annual contract cost) will become due to the Company.<br> 1.8 Normal Working

							installations, upgrades, remedial works and supply only can be made via the following methods.<br> Account

							carriage will be borne by the Customer. Callouts outside of the UK mainland will be quoted to the customer
							on a visit-by-visit basis. <br> We aim to attend site within 3 working days from receipt of
							Customer&rsquo;s order securing engineers on site visit. <br> 3.3 Routine Proactive Preventative

							the Customer&rsquo;s computer network security and will not be held liable for any security breaches of
							the network. The Customer is wholly responsible for the security policies and procedures of their network
							and the protection of data accessible via the network.<br> 3.6 Passwords:<br> Engineer level access allows
							access to technical configuration which is normally only appropriate to engineers who have technical
							training in system configuration. Errors in configuration settings can render the system inoperable and

							of rates. When Security systems are being taken over by Osprey Security, it is assumed that the Customer

							Customer.<br> 3.7 Faulty Equipment:<br> Where faulty equipment requires repeated engineer call-out

							within 14 days. In the event of termination under this clause the Company shall refund to the customer any
							pre-paid maintenance charge relating to the period after the date of termination. <br> 4.3 Delays:<br>
							Whilst the Company in good faith gives a time and date for any visit of the Fire and/or Security System,
							it shall be held harmless and not liable for delays caused by strikes, lockouts, labour disputes, weather
							conditions, traffic congestion or diversions, temporary police or Local Authority regulations or
							manufacturers&rsquo; or distributors&rsquo; material delays. These events will not give rise to a breach
							of contract on the Company's part subject always to the Company using all reasonable endeavours to avoid
							any such delays and the Company notifying the customer of the delay.<br> 4.4 Law:<br> This agreement is
							governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English Law.<br> 4.5 Transfer and Change of
